Here you can find 2 codes. 
 The first one called Single_Sheet_Stock_Analyzer is a single sheet summary code for a 7 column stock spreadsheet. 
 The second code called Multiple_Sheet_Stock_Analyzer is a similar code but it creas a new Combined Sheet and then summarizes the data in that Combined Sheet. (This code is an in-progress code).
 
 You can also find several pictures of how the first code works on a spreadsheet.
